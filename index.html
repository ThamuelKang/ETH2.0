                <h2>What is ETH 2.0?</h2>
                <p>The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, called Serenity, is a long anticipated change to the smart contracts
                    protocol that will address scalability issues by improving Ethereum’s ability to confirm, verify,
                    and execute transactions. The upgrade will move the network from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus
                    algorithm to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and lessen transaction gas costs. </p>

                <h2>Why is an upgrade needed?</h2>
                <p>To date, the Ethereum network has experienced significant slow downs and volatile fees that make it
                    difficult and unreliable to send or receive a transaction. Because the present state of the network
                    requires all nodes to verify and execute transactions, one application has the ability to congest
                    the entire network. These upgrades don’t just support the Ethereum network, they impact and benefit
                    the entire cryptocurrency industry.</p>

                <h3>Proof-of-Stake </h3>

                <li>Having to stake ETH acts as a security measure ensuring that participants act in the best interest
                    of
                    the network; if they act against the network, their ETH can be forfeited. </li>
                <li>
                    Increases network decentralization because it reduces barriers, allowing more nodes to join the
                    network.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moving to PoS is intended to make the network more energy efficient, requiring network validators to
                    stake ETH rather than perform work to confirm transactions.
                </li>
            </div>

            <div class="upgrade_info">
                <h3>Scalability: Data Sharding </h3>

                <li>Scalability relates to the network’s capacity for executing transactions. Presently, every
                    transaction
                    has to be verified and executed by every Ethereum node. This makes the network slow and costly to
                    use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data sharding is an important element of the upgrade that supports improved scalability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sharding separates a large database into smaller and more manageable pieces of data. For Ethereum,
                    sharding will partition the database so that more nodes can be added and process transactions
                    faster.
